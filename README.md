# Spy_hunter
Spy hunter is a game that simulates a car driving.  Player gets point for driving distance 
and killing enemy car(Red Car). Enemy cars are blocking the road. He can get negative points for driving off the road or
killing natural car (Green Car). Player should avoid obstacles (puddles), because they cause skid.
Player can also get super ammo, which has longer shot distnace.

I had made this project, before I got to know Git.
